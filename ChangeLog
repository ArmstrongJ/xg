   - added changes by R.Mannigel:
     - wind_set_proc() to set window title icons.
     - shel_write (SWM_BROADCAST, ...) to notify other applications about color
       palette changed.
     - recive COLORS_CHANGEDbroadcast message.
   - implemented SetClosedownMode() to avoid removing of client resources which
     want to retain after disconnecting.  This allowes Motif applications like
     netscape to install their nifty refference windows.
   - improved cleanup after client abort to avoid memory leaks.
   - added forgotten byte-swapping for pixmap line coordinates.
   - typo fixed which caused wrong BadMatch replies for some CreateCursor()
     request.
