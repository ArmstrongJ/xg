Fonts
=====

In X, fonts are named following the XLFD ('X Logical Font Description').  These
font names are in fact a set of descriptive fields with '-' as delimiters.  The
format is as following:
   -fndry-fmly-wght-slnt-sWd-adStyl-pxlSz-ptSz-resx-resy-spc-avgWd-rgstry-enc

with the field meaning:

fndry:  Foundry is the name of the organization that supplied or last modified
   the font, e.g. Adobe, Bitstream.
fmly:   FamilyName of the font, e.g. Courier, Gothic, Helvetica
wght:   WeightName, e.g. Bold, Medim, Black
slnt:   Slant, a code-string with tha encoding: "R"=Roman, "I"=Italic, aso.
sWd:    SetWidth, e.g. Normal, Condensed, Narrow
adStyl: AddStyle, e.g. Sans, Serif,
pxlSz:  PixelSize of the body of the font, similar to the character cell in VDI
ptSz:   PointSize in decipoint, that is 1/10th point
resx,resy:   horizontal/vertical resolution for which the font was designed
spc:    Spacing, code-string to indicate the escapement, that is "P" for
        proportional and "M" or "C" for monospaced
avgWd:  AverageWidth of all characters in 1/20th pixels
rgstry,enc:   CharsetRegistry/Encoding, e.g. ISO8859-1

All of these fields my contain wildcards (a '*').  For example, often clients
requests a font named '-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-ISO8859-1' which means some
font of 12 point height and that charset encoding is needed, no matter of which
family or style and so on.  The server will than take the first font of where
this both criteria matches.

Handling of GEM-Fonts
---------------------

At startup, the server parses all fonts provided by the VDI and translates the
available informations to XLFD strings.  These are stored in the hash file
/var/lib/Xapp/fonts.db to accelerate further startups.

Font-Aliasing
-------------

If there exists a file /usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts.alias it will be read at server
startup and later be used to substitute font names from client requests.  The
format of these file is simply
   <requested font><space/tab><font to use instead>
in each line.  To edit this file, have a look at /var/lib/Xapp/fonts.db to see
which fonts are provided.

There are two often requested pseudo-fonts which should allways be aliased:

fixed: A monospaced font that fits best the system capabilities, e.g. the font
       used the AES, or some other monospaced font of your choice.

variable: Some proportional font which should be of the same height as the font
          used for fixed.

To use the fonts from the NVDI package, it could looks like

fixed   -Bitstream-Courier10Pitch-Medium-I-Normal-Serif-16-90-0-0-C-70-ISO8859-1
variable -Bitstream-Life-Medium-R-Normal-Serif-16-90-0-0-P-68-ISO8859-1

The font to be substituted can also be a pattern, like

-adobe-times-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1 \
                                          -*-times*-medium-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
-*-Helvetica-Medium-R-Normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*	\
                                       -*-gothic*-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*

Please pay attention that the '\' isn't allowed in the font.alias file; it's
only used here for better radability!

There are other oftern used fot names of the form '9x15', '6x13' and so on,
which means monospaced fonts of <width> * <height> pixel size.  If an request of
such a font name appeares and the server can't find it in its XLFD list nor in
the alias list, it takes a scalable font which can scaled best to that geometry
and creates a generic XLFD entry.
